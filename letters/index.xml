      <description>Dear you,
Do you know what you&amp;rsquo;ve done to me? My favorite lies came from your lips. My favorite distractions from your words. My favorite songs from your silence.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about silence, actually. You sure have given me a lot of it, haven&amp;rsquo;t you? Given me things to think about. I used to constantly say &amp;ldquo;easier said than done&amp;rdquo; but silence is easier done than said.</description>
