      <description>Dear Mikhail,
You inspire me. I never would have gotten into technology stuff if it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been for you. Thank you for always being here. Thank you for everything!!!!! You&amp;rsquo;re a butt :) I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I got to spend your birthday with you. I hope you like what I got you, and I am so excited to be here for every birthday to follow!!!
Love,
Abbie</description>

      <description>Dear you,
Thank you for making my life better. Thank you for always being there. I feel like whenever my world starts to fall apart, I&amp;rsquo;m honored to have someone like you to help me put the pieces back together. It makes me happy when we stay up late together (mom, if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, I have never once stayed up late on the phone! Whaaat??) and when we meet up, even if it&amp;rsquo;s only for a few minutes.</description>

      <description>Dear you,
Do you know what you&amp;rsquo;ve done to me? My favorite lies came from your lips. My favorite distractions from your words. My favorite songs from your silence.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about silence, actually. You sure have given me a lot of it, haven&amp;rsquo;t you? Given me things to think about. I used to constantly say &amp;ldquo;easier said than done&amp;rdquo; but silence is easier done than said.</description>
