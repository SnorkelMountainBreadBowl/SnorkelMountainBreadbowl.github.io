<p>Dear you,<br>
Do you know what you&rsquo;ve done to me? My favorite lies came from your lips. My favorite distractions from your words. My favorite songs from your silence.<br>
I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about silence, actually. You sure have given me a lot of it, haven&rsquo;t you? Given me things to think about. I used to constantly say &ldquo;easier said than done&rdquo; but silence is easier done than said. I can&rsquo;t speak to you, and that was easy for you to accomplish&hellip; But not for me. Do you know that I remember you every day? One day you will see your loss.<br>
I have found someone with eyes so beautiful you&rsquo;d wish you&rsquo;d never hurt me. But I&rsquo;ve learned some things from you, Blue Eyes.<br>
Number 1) You taught me that I really need to decide who to trust. You told me many things I thought were true. It is only lately that I see the logical fallacies in each beautiful lie you told me.<br>
Number 2) You have shown me that the clearest path is not the best one. Loving you was simple and clear. It seemed the obvious choice to choose someone unattainable, until I attained them. Things happened that I never thought could happen to me. And I assumed I was lucky. I wasn&rsquo;t lucky, but now I am. Blue Eyes, there is someone who doesn&rsquo;t hurt me anymore. He was not the clear path. But there is something special about someone like that. You are so common here. There are plenty of jerks at dead-end jobs. But now, I found my Iridium. It&rsquo;s an element that&rsquo;s rare here on Earth, but so common in the stars. You know what else is common in the stars? My love. Because that&rsquo;s how far it reaches. There&rsquo;s someone who would run a mile just to give me a hug, drive twenty minutes just to give me a letter, make me my favorite foods, and so, so much more that someone like you couldn&rsquo;t even begin to fathom.<br>
There are many more things I could name, but seeing as you&rsquo;ll never read this and I&rsquo;ve already wasted too many words on you, I&rsquo;ll end it here.<br>
-Abbie
