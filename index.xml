      <description>Sometimes when people ask me to make a wish
I fumble for the right words to say
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I should tell the truth
I want someone to stay
Because what if I were to tell them?
What do you think they&amp;rsquo;d do?
If I were to say
I make each wish for you?</description>

      <description>Dear you,
Do you know what you&amp;rsquo;ve done to me? My favorite lies came from your lips. My favorite distractions from your words. My favorite songs from your silence.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about silence, actually. You sure have given me a lot of it, haven&amp;rsquo;t you? Given me things to think about. I used to constantly say &amp;ldquo;easier said than done&amp;rdquo; but silence is easier done than said.</description>

      <description>I am now testing my website. Thanks for looking at my first post! We have a long way to go, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see where this goes! Credit to my amazing best friend, Mikhail, for teaching me everything I needed to know to put this together. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have done this without him! He made this process fun and exciting instead of boring and confusing. I owe it all to him!</description>
