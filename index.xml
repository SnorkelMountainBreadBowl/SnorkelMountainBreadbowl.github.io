      <description>My boyfriend and I do this thing I call One More Hug, and it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite things about our relationship.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure which of us started it, but I remember vividly when we were on a date as I hugged him goodbye, it was so hard to say goodbye. I walked away to my car sadly and put on my seatbelt and heard a tapping at the passenger window.</description>

      <description>Okay guys, so I watched the movie Braveheart a night or two ago, and I&amp;rsquo;m a wee bit angry at this thing they call a &amp;lsquo;movie&amp;rsquo;. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched it, I highly DO NOT recommend, because it is sad and angering. But for those of you who haven&amp;rsquo;t watched it, there are basically 8 steps to the plot.
 There&amp;rsquo;s a dude named William Wallace. He likes a girl.</description>

      <description>Dear you,
Thank you for making my life better. Thank you for always being there. I feel like whenever my world starts to fall apart, I&amp;rsquo;m honored to have someone like you to help me put the pieces back together. It makes me happy when we stay up late together (mom, if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, I have never once stayed up late on the phone! Whaaat??) and when we meet up, even if it&amp;rsquo;s only for a few minutes.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be seventeen soon. Tomorrow, actually, for those of you who may read this in the nearby future. I&amp;rsquo;m seventeen, but I still haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything I wanted to do yet. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been around the world, gotten my own pet, gotten my license, or gotten a real job.
What&amp;rsquo;s one more year in this existence?
 Abbie,

      <description>Whenever you&amp;rsquo;re upset or hurting, I just want to hold you close and remind you everything will be okay. Maybe it isn&amp;rsquo;t right now, but I swear to you, in the end, it will be. And I&amp;rsquo;ll be here until then

      <description>So yeah, maybe it hurts
Just a little, just a lot
Maybe it hurts too much sometimes
Just a little. Just a lot.
I remember times we had.
Hugs in the parking lot?
Maybe it hurts too much sometimes
Just a little. Just a lot.
You leave again and again
Turning around on the spot
Maybe it hurts so much sometimes
Just a little. Just a lot.
You blocked me, how is that fair?</description>

      <description>Baby, can you tell me how many
Stars are in the sky?
Tell me how many
Or even try
My love for you is bigger
Than the ocean is deep
I love you awake
I love you asleep
I love you to the stars
And over the moon
I love you far away
I love you so soon
I love you deep
I love you wide
I love you with me</description>

      <description>Okay, so I&amp;rsquo;m not insane. There&amp;rsquo;s a really pretty ring I found on Amazon, but it&amp;rsquo;s like thirty bucks and so I can&amp;rsquo;t afford it but it&amp;rsquo;s got a sunflower on it and says &amp;ldquo;You Are My Sunshine&amp;rdquo; and I love it more than life itself.
So&amp;hellip; Note to future self&amp;hellip; https://www.amazon.com/Sterling-Silver-Sunshine-Sunflower-Adjustable/dp/B07RLD2DV1/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=sunflower+ring&amp;amp;qid=1589134401&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE2REdNVzcxNklZMjcmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAzMzk1OTczMlpJSEJJOVZROUw1JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAwMDQ4MTQySUZDUUY1MUZURlpLJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

Has a sunflower in the middle
Silver and gold bb
SHE IS MY BABY

It&amp;rsquo;s a ring I want

Even better than Gerard Butler
You are my sunshine

      <description>I cry tears that aren&amp;rsquo;t sad
Let them burn and burn
The tears are here because I&amp;rsquo;m mad
Cuz I&amp;rsquo;m not weak
No, I&amp;rsquo;m not weak
I shake and scream at the sky
Let him burn and burn!
The screams can&amp;rsquo;t reach the sky
Cuz I&amp;rsquo;m not weak
No, I&amp;rsquo;m not weak
I shut the whole world out
Please go burn and burn
The world isn&amp;rsquo;t in my hands?
Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m weak</description>

      <title>The Dreaded AP Biology Test</title>

      <description>The day had finally come. I was testing by myself, with a beady-eyed old lady who looked like she could easily cut off my hands. She pointed at my chair, and I sat down promptly, and began to remember all the things I did, or perhaps didn&amp;rsquo;t do to prepare for the Advanced Placement Biology Exam.
I remembered the girl with the long brown hair and the girl with the obnoxiously red hair.</description>

      <description>Sometimes when people ask me to make a wish
I fumble for the right words to say
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I should tell the truth
I want someone to stay
Because what if I were to tell them?
What do you think they&amp;rsquo;d do?
If I were to say
I make each wish for you?</description>

      <description>Dear you,
Do you know what you&amp;rsquo;ve done to me? My favorite lies came from your lips. My favorite distractions from your words. My favorite songs from your silence.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about silence, actually. You sure have given me a lot of it, haven&amp;rsquo;t you? Given me things to think about. I used to constantly say &amp;ldquo;easier said than done&amp;rdquo; but silence is easier done than said.</description>

      <description>I am now testing my website. Thanks for looking at my first post! We have a long way to go, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see where this goes! Credit to my amazing best friend, Mikhail, for teaching me everything I needed to know to put this together. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have done this without him! He made this process fun and exciting instead of boring and confusing. I owe it all to him!</description>
