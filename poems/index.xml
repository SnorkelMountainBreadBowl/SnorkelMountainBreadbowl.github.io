      <description>So yeah, maybe it hurts
Just a little, just a lot
Maybe it hurts too much sometimes
Just a little. Just a lot.
I remember times we had.
Hugs in the parking lot?
Maybe it hurts too much sometimes
Just a little. Just a lot.
You leave again and again
Turning around on the spot
Maybe it hurts so much sometimes
Just a little. Just a lot.
You blocked me, how is that fair?</description>

      <description>Baby, can you tell me how many
Stars are in the sky?
Tell me how many
Or even try
My love for you is bigger
Than the ocean is deep
I love you awake
I love you asleep
I love you to the stars
And over the moon
I love you far away
I love you so soon
I love you deep
I love you wide
I love you with me</description>

      <description>My baby
Has a sunflower in the middle
Silver and gold bb
SHE IS MY BABY
I&amp;rsquo;m not weird
It&amp;rsquo;s a ring I want
Size eight, my baby
Even better than Gerard Butler
You are my sunshine
Bb
 Abbie
Over and out

      <description>I cry tears that aren&amp;rsquo;t sad
Let them burn and burn
The tears are here because I&amp;rsquo;m mad
Cuz I&amp;rsquo;m not weak
No, I&amp;rsquo;m not weak
I shake and scream at the sky
Let him burn and burn!
The screams can&amp;rsquo;t reach the sky
Cuz I&amp;rsquo;m not weak
No, I&amp;rsquo;m not weak
I shut the whole world out
Please go burn and burn
The world isn&amp;rsquo;t in my hands?
Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m weak</description>

      <description>Sometimes when people ask me to make a wish
I fumble for the right words to say
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I should tell the truth
I want someone to stay
Because what if I were to tell them?
What do you think they&amp;rsquo;d do?
If I were to say
I make each wish for you?</description>

      <description>There once was a girl named Abbie
She lived and was sorta crabby
Then she made a blog
Something something dog
This is a test, don&amp;rsquo;t stab me</description>
