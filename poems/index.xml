      <description>Sometimes when people ask me to make a wish
I fumble for the right words to say
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I should tell the truth
I want someone to stay
Because what if I were to tell them?
What do you think they&amp;rsquo;d do?
If I were to say
I make each wish for you?</description>

She lived and was sorta crabby
Then she made a blog
Something something dog
