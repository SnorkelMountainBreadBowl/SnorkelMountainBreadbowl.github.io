      <description>I cry tears that aren&amp;rsquo;t sad
Let them burn and burn
The tears are here because I&amp;rsquo;m mad
Cuz I&amp;rsquo;m not weak
No, I&amp;rsquo;m not weak
I shake and scream at the sky
Let him burn and burn!
The screams can&amp;rsquo;t reach the sky
Cuz I&amp;rsquo;m not weak
No, I&amp;rsquo;m not weak
I shut the whole world out
Please go burn and burn
The world isn&amp;rsquo;t in my hands?
Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m weak</description>

      <description>Sometimes when people ask me to make a wish
I fumble for the right words to say
I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I should tell the truth
I want someone to stay
Because what if I were to tell them?
What do you think they&amp;rsquo;d do?
If I were to say
I make each wish for you?</description>

      <description>There once was a girl named Abbie
She lived and was sorta crabby
Then she made a blog
Something something dog
This is a test, don&amp;rsquo;t stab me</description>
