&amp;ldquo;My girlfriend says I can have as many boyfriends as I want!&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;We gotta hurry. Paw Patrol is on at ten.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lt;- (from a grown man at the grocery store)
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not high, I just look like it.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I gotta go to the bathroom. Not to pee. But just as a field trip for myself.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Well, we ran out of steak patties.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be seventeen soon. Tomorrow, actually, for those of you who may read this in the nearby future. I&amp;rsquo;m seventeen, but I still haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything I wanted to do yet. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been around the world, gotten my own pet, gotten my license, or gotten a real job.
What&amp;rsquo;s one more year in this existence?
 Abbie,
Over and out

      <description>Whenever you&amp;rsquo;re upset or hurting, I just want to hold you close and remind you everything will be okay. Maybe it isn&amp;rsquo;t right now, but I swear to you, in the end, it will be. And I&amp;rsquo;ll be here until then

      <description>Okay, so I&amp;rsquo;m not insane. There&amp;rsquo;s a really pretty ring I found on Amazon, but it&amp;rsquo;s like thirty bucks and so I can&amp;rsquo;t afford it but it&amp;rsquo;s got a sunflower on it and says &amp;ldquo;You Are My Sunshine&amp;rdquo; and I love it more than life itself.
So&amp;hellip; Note to future self&amp;hellip; https://www.amazon.com/Sterling-Silver-Sunshine-Sunflower-Adjustable/dp/B07RLD2DV1/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=sunflower+ring&amp;amp;qid=1589134401&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUE2REdNVzcxNklZMjcmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAzMzk1OTczMlpJSEJJOVZROUw1JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAwMDQ4MTQySUZDUUY1MUZURlpLJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==

      <description>I am now testing my website. Thanks for looking at my first post! We have a long way to go, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see where this goes! Credit to my amazing best friend, Mikhail, for teaching me everything I needed to know to put this together. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have done this without him! He made this process fun and exciting instead of boring and confusing. I owe it all to him!</description>
