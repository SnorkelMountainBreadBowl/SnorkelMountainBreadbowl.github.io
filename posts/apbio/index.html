    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>      The day had finally come. I was testing by myself, with a beady-eyed old lady who looked like she could easily cut off my hands. She pointed at my chair, and I sat down promptly, and began to remember all the things I did, or perhaps <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> do to prepare for the Advanced Placement Biology Exam.<br>
      <em><strong>I remembered the girl with the long brown hair and the girl with the obnoxiously red hair. Always making notecards that had little drawings. Always doing their bullet journals or gun diaries or shotgun notepads or whatever the hell they&rsquo;re called. The kinds of girls so perfect you either wanted to be their best friends or punch them in the face. They seemed to have their whole lives put together and sealed with lip gloss. But seriously guys, if you&rsquo;re reading this, how did you do it? How??</strong></em><br>
      <em><strong>They seemed to have everything put together, including AP Biology. And then, of course, there was me. Sitting in the corner, always tapping my feet and drawing, humming, or making little paper birds to later throw at my boyfriend. I got good grades in the class, but I NEVER studied. Not once. I would do horribly on tests and quizzes, but pull my grade up to a B or so by doing well on the open-note homework assignments. But then came the end of the year.</strong></em><br>
      <em><strong>My teacher told us we would be having quizzes on every unit we had learned thus far. And I swear, I think my heart stopped beating for a few seconds. Quizzes?? On every unit?? To provide some context, we had only a few weeks left of school and eleven units to take quizzes on. And worst of all, no homework assignments to bring up my grades. Just bad quiz grade after bad quiz grade. So I studied for the first time in my entire life, and managed to pull through the class with a B after extensive all-nighters and many tears. But still, the hell wasn&rsquo;t over. Because next came the actual test, and boy oh boy, was I screwed.</strong></em><br>
      <em><strong>To practice for said test, my teacher held afterschool study sessions. At first, when she mentioned these, I told myself there was NO way I was going to attend a nerd group afterschool. But then my teacher started throwing around serious, compelling words like &ldquo;free pizza&rdquo; and I couldn&rsquo;t help but immediately want to attend. Though, to be fair, the only thing i did was color the entire time. But I still got free pizza.</strong></em><br>
      So there I was, sitting with that lady staring at me, leaning over my shoulder. I wanted to puke, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was because of her breath on my ear or the sudden realization I was about to be the first person to get a zero on a test that grades from one to five. She instructed me on how to fill in the bubbles on the answer sheet with my demographic information, my hand shaking slightly.<br>
      As I turned the page and began to answer, I realized just how screwed over I really was. Without exaggeration, I can say I knew NONE of the questions. But then it got even worse. I flipped the page to the open response questions. There was no longer the safe protection of the multiple choice. Instead, I needed to pull something that sounded scientific from my completely empty knowledge of biology.<br>
            <em>Seagrasses are aquatic plants that reproduce sexually. Male seagrass flowers produce sticky pollen that is carried by circulating water to female flowers, resulting in fertilization. Draw the appropriate symbols in the negative control aquarium AND the experimental aquarium. Do not use any symbol more than once in the same aquarium.</em><br>
      Well, crap. What the hell was I supposed to do with that? I didn&rsquo;t know how to answer that! I don&rsquo;t care about seagrasses! I then developed an ingenius plan to win the hearts of the people who would grade my test. I put my pencil to the paper and began my masterpiece.<br>
            <em>Well, I <strong>could</strong> draw you some diagrams of seagrass sex, but let&rsquo;s think about this- and I mean really think about it. Think of your children and the children they will have. Should we really be diagramming sex for this test? Is that a proper thing to introduce to high school students? So grade this answer with the highest points possible. If not for me, do it for America. I rest my case, and God bless America!</em><br>
      Proud of my completely BS answer, I glanced up briefly at the old lady supervising me. Her eyes were closed? Was she dead? Oh well. I continued with each question. I somehow found a way to BS my way out of actual answers, until I got to a question about theory. I really strugged with that one until I finally wrote down the greatest statement I have ever come up with.<br>
            <em>So, you&rsquo;ve probably heard of Superman versus Batman. But just riddle me this: switch them around a bit, and you&rsquo;ll get Superbat versus manman and if that&rsquo;s not something you want to see, then you&rsquo;re not worth my time. I digress.</em><br>
      Finally satisfied, I turned in my paper and went back to class. Later in the summer, I got the score. I mean, you get what you worked for.<br>
                        I got a one.</p>
