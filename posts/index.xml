      <description>Okay guys, so I watched the movie Braveheart a night or two ago, and I&amp;rsquo;m a wee bit angry at this thing they call a &amp;lsquo;movie&amp;rsquo;. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t watched it, I highly DO NOT recommend, because it is sad and angering. But for those of you who haven&amp;rsquo;t watched it, there are basically 8 steps to the plot.
 There&amp;rsquo;s a dude named William Wallace. He likes a girl.</description>

I remembered the girl with the long brown hair and the girl with the obnoxiously red hair.</description>
